# Welcome to AussieXenu's GitHub
One crazy Aussie's journey towards learning Python/C#/Whatever-else-floats-my-boat. Because it's about damn time I started doing stuff I actually enjoy!

Content has changed somewhat since I first wrote this up, focus is now on repo's for each project/book that I am leveraging towards my end goal of actually having something more than passing knowledge. Programming, as they say, is like anything else - Cannae improve if ye dinnae do et!
