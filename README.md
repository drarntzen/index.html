# Welcome to AussieXenu's GitHub
One crazy Aussie's journey towards learning Python/R, with a side order of data analysis. Because it's about damn time I started doing stuff I actually enjoy!

To further this goal, I intend to make at least one commit a day in addition to various self-taught shenanigans. Proper commits, that is; it might look minor looking back at it but at the time it's still one tiny step towards proficiency.

Current projects/meanderings/random stuff:
- [Historical temperature range: Perth Airport, WA](../../../temp-perthairport) (I work in this area, so seemed as good a place as any to practice data wrangling).

[LinkedIn Profile, mostly as proof I'm (allegedly) an actual human](http://www.linkedin.com/in/drarntzen)
