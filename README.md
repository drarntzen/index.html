# Welcome to AussieXenu's GitHub
One crazy Aussie's journey towards learning Python/R, with a side order of data analysis. Because it's about damn time I started doing stuff I actually enjoy!

Looks like I've thrown MongoDB into the mix as well, because why the hell not I guess? Looking like a good choice as traditional RDBMS seem to be on the way out as far as "Big Data" goes. Could be wrong though, it's happened before :)

To further this goal, I intend to make at least one commit a day in addition to various self-taught shenanigans. Proper commits, that is; it might look minor looking back at it but at the time it's still one tiny step towards proficiency.

Current projects/meanderings/random stuff:
- [Historical temperature range: Perth Airport, WA](../../../temp-perthairport) (I work in this area, so seemed as good a place as any to practice data wrangling).
- Searchable Goods Outwards database, initially in CSV but eventually will be SQLite with any luck.

[LinkedIn Profile, mostly as proof I'm (allegedly) an actual human](http://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-arntzen-320565122)
