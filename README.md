# Welcome to AussieXenu's GitHub
One crazy Aussie's journey towards learning Python/R, with a side order of data analysis. Because it's about damn time I started doing stuff I actually enjoy!

Current projects/meanderings/random stuff:
- Historical temperature range: Perth Airport, WA (I work in this area, so seemed as good a place as any to practice data wrangling).
