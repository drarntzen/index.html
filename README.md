# Welcome to Damian Arntzen's GitHub
A while ago I decided, for what feels like the millionth time, to actually start doing more of what I enjoy. This includes not just trying to become a computer magician (Because the more I learn, the more "major" programming still feels like magic! [I realise it is not. Really. It just boggles the mind at how it all intertwines to become something useable]), but continuing to learn something. I will claim that a good day is one you learn something in, however I've had precious little of them in recent times.

Languages I am passingly familiar with: 
* C++/C# (Aside from the obligatory BASIC as a young 'un, C++ and Pascal were my entry into the world of programming)
* Python
* R (Very limited, although I do like it as data manipulation language)
* JavaScript - Just added to the mix recently, reminds me of C so far.

Languages I really should learn more:
* SQL - I realise I am probably in the minority here, but even with the realisation a lot of existing tech uses it... it's a horrid language. I really don't like it, even if I can utilise it for basic functions.

Technology that excites me:
* NoSQL (And not just because of my dislike of SQL). RDB's, like all other technological feats, helped move us forward in so many ways. This is, to me, just the next evolutionary step in the process.
* The IoT - As fraught as it is with potential for abuse and exploitation, the interconnectedness and ease of just communication that the Internet provides is a major technological positive.

I've decided to move my progress tracker repo's to Gitlab, and focus on making this one more akin to a portfolio of stuff I've actually finished (No matter how minor).
